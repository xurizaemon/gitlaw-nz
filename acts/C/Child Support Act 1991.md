##### 4A Overview of child support payable under formula assessment

(1) 

A parent or non-parent carer of a qualifying child may apply to the Commissioner for a formula assessment of child support payable for that child by a liable parent.

(2) 

The Commissioner will then determine the proportion of care that each carer of the child provides, and the income of each parent of the child, and, using that information, will identify the parent or parents who are liable to pay child support, and the carer or carers who are entitled to receive child support, in respect of the child.

(3) 

A person will be a liable parent in respect of a child if his or her income percentage (which is a percentage of the combined child support income amounts of both the child's parents) is greater than the person's care cost percentage (which is a cost percentage directly related to the proportion of care that the parent provides to the child).

(4) 

If annual child support is payable by a liable parent for a qualifying child, the amount is determined under [Part 2][44]. It is worked out by deducting the liable parent's care cost percentage from their income percentage, and then multiplying the result by the appropriate amount set out in the relevant child expenditure table (which identifies, amongst other things, the average annual expenditure on children in New Zealand, by reference to average weekly earnings).

(5) 

This section is by way of explanation only. If it is inconsistent with any other provision of this Act, the other provision prevails.

Section 4A: inserted, on 1 April 2015, by [section 8][547] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 14 Commissioner to establish proportions of care

(1) 

The Commissioner must establish, for each qualifying child to whom a properly completed application relates, the proportion of ongoing daily care that each parent and non-parent carer identified in the application, or in other information provided following a request under [section 13(2)][22], provides to the child.

(2) 

If 2 or more people who live together each provide ongoing daily care to a child,---

##### (a) 

only 1 of those people may be treated as a carer, and the care provided by the other persons must be treated as part of the care provided by the first person; and

##### (b) 

if 1 of the people is a parent of the child, that person must be treated as the carer.

(3) 

The parents of a qualifying child in respect of whom payments are being made under [section 363][560] of the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 are deemed to provide no ongoing daily care to the child.

Section 14: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 10][559] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 15 How Commissioner establishes proportions of care

(1) 

For the purpose of [section 14][24], the Commissioner must (subject to subsection (3)) rely on the content of any care order or agreement relating to a qualifying child when establishing the proportion of ongoing daily care that a carer provides to the child.

(2) 

If a care order or agreement specifies the proportion of nights that a child is to spend with a carer, that proportion of nights is taken to be the proportion of ongoing daily care provided to the child by that carer.

(3) 

A parent or carer of a qualifying child may challenge the application of subsection (1) or (2) by providing evidence of---

##### (a) 

why a care order or agreement should not be relied on; or

##### (b) 

why the proportion of nights that a child spends with a carer should not be taken to be the proportion of ongoing daily care provided to that child by that carer.

(4) 

If there is no care order or agreement relating to the child, or if the Commissioner is satisfied, on the basis of evidence provided, that a care order or agreement does not accurately reflect the proportion of ongoing daily care provided by a carer to a child, the Commissioner must establish the proportion of care provided by a carer primarily on the basis of the number of nights that the child spends with the carer.

(5) 

If the Commissioner is satisfied, on the basis of evidence provided, that the number of nights spent with a carer is not a true reflection of the proportion of care actually provided by a carer to the child, the Commissioner must establish the proportion of care provided on the basis of the amount of time that the carer is the person responsible for the daily care of the child.

(6) 

When establishing proportions of care, the Commissioner---

##### (a) 

must use only whole percentage figures and, for that purpose, must round figures over 50% upwards to the next whole percentage figure, and figures under 50% downwards to the next whole percentage figure; and

##### (b) 

must assume that every year has 365 days.

##### 16 Determining care cost percentages

(1) 

The Commissioner must determine the care cost percentage of each parent and carer of a qualifying child on the basis of the proportion of care that the Commissioner has established, under [section 14][24], that each carer provides to the child.

(2) 

The care cost percentage that applies is the relevant percentage set out in, or determined in accordance with, column 2 of the table in [Schedule 2][498].

(1) 

The Commissioner must determine the liable parents and receiving carers of each qualifying child, in accordance with this section.

(2)

(3) 

A parent of a qualifying child is a receiving carer of the child if the parent's income percentage is less than their care cost percentage for the child.

(3A) 

Despite subsections (2) and (3), a parent whose income percentage is 100% and whose care cost percentage is also 100% is a receiving carer.

(4) 

A non-parent carer of a qualifying child is a receiving carer of the child if the carer provides at least 35% of ongoing daily care to the child.

##### 18 Effect of being liable parent or receiving carer

(1)

(2)

from the day on which the properly completed application for that formula assessment is received by the Commissioner; or

##### (b) 

if a reassessment results in a person being identified as a liable parent, from the date specified in the reassessment as the effective date.

(2) 

If a parent becomes liable to pay child support to a person in relation to a child under a formula assessment, any existing liability of that parent to pay child support to the person in relation to that child under any voluntary agreement is suspended between the commencement of liability to pay under the formula assessment and the end of that liability.

(3) 

If the Commissioner receives an application for a formula assessment that names a person as a parent of a qualifying child (_person P_), but person P is not at that time a parent of the child within the meaning of [section 7][12], then, if the application is otherwise properly completed, liability by person P to pay child support in respect of the child starts from the day on which the application was received if---

##### (a) 

a court later declares person P to be the parent of the child, or person P is later declared to be a parent of the child by an order made by a court or a public authority in an overseas jurisdiction; and

##### (b) 

the Commissioner determines under this Part that person P is a liable parent of the child.

Section 29: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 12][567] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 30 Formula for assessing annual amount of child support

(1) 

The formula for assessing the annual amount of child support payable under a formula assessment by a liable parent in a child support year in respect of a qualifying child is the parent's income percentage minus the parent's care cost percentage, multiplied by the child expenditure amount for the child. This formula can be expressed as---

(i%  c%)  p

where---

**i% **
> 
> is the liable parent's income percentage determined under [section 33][52]

**c% **
> 
> is the liable parent's care cost percentage determined under [section 16][26]

**p **
> 
> is the child expenditure amount for a qualifying child.

(2) 

The _child expenditure amount_ for a qualifying child in a child support year is---

e

n

where---

**e **
> 
> is the amount, determined in accordance with the child expenditure table applying to that child support year, that applies to the parent in respect of the child on the basis of---
> 
> ##### (a) 
> 
> the combined child support income amounts of both parents of the child; and
> 
> ##### (b) 
> 
> the number of children in the child's child support group; and
> 
> ##### (c) 
> 
> the age group of those children

**n **
> 
> is the number of children in the same child support group as the child.

Section 30: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 12][567] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 31 Annual amount of child support payable by liable parent

(1) 

The annual amount of child support payable under a formula assessment by a liable parent in respect of a qualifying child is nil, and [section 32][50] does not apply, if---

##### (a) 

the liable parent provides more than 65% of ongoing daily care to the child; or

##### (b) 

the liable parent provides at least 28% of ongoing daily care to the child and the liable parent's income percentage is equal to their care cost percentage; or

##### (c) 

no receiving carer provides at least 35% of ongoing daily care to the child.

(2) 

Where subsection (1) does not apply, the annual amount of child support payable under a formula assessment by a liable parent in a child support year in respect of a qualifying child is as follows:

##### (a) 

the amount determined in accordance with the formula set out in [section 30(1)][47], unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies:

##### (b) 

for a liable parent to whom [section 36][57] applies but [section 36A][59] does not,---

##### (i) 

the amount determined in accordance with the formula set out in [section 30(1)][47]; or

##### (ii) 

the amount determined under the multi-group cap (referred to in subsection (3)) applying to the child, but only if it is less than the amount referred to in subparagraph (i):

##### (c) 

for a parent to whom [section 36A][59] applies (whether or not [section 36][57] also applies),---

##### (i) 

the amount determined in accordance with the formula set out in [section 30(1)][47]; or

##### (ii) 

if the multi-group cap applies, the amount determined under the multi-group cap applying to the child, but only if it is less than the amount referred to in subparagraph (i); or

##### (iii) 

the amount payable in respect of a receiving carer under [section 36A][59], but only if it is less than each of the amounts referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii).

(3) 

The _multi-group cap_ for a child is the amount determined as follows:

(100%  c%)  m

where---

**c% **
> 
> is the parent's care cost percentage in relation to the child

**m **
> 
> is the multi-group cost of the child, as determined under [section 36(4)][57].

(4) 

The purpose of the multi-group cap is to avoid liable parents paying more in child support than they would pay if all the children for whom they are liable to pay child support were living together.

If, after assessing the annual amount of child support payable by a liable parent in respect of each of his or her qualifying children, the Commissioner determines that the total amount payable by the parent is less than the minimum annual rate referred to in [section 72(1)(a)][118], the Commissioner must, despite [sections 30][47] and [31(2)][48],---

##### (a) 

assess the parent's annual rate of child support as the minimum annual rate referred to in [section 72(1)(a)][118]; and

##### (b) 

determine the proportion of that minimum annual rate of child support that is payable in respect of each receiving carer, on the basis of the number of qualifying children of the liable parent that each carer provides care for.

Heading: inserted, on 1 April 2015, by [section 12][567] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 33 Income percentage

A parent's _income percentage_, in relation to a qualifying child, is the percentage figure derived by dividing the person's child support income amount (as determined under [section 34][53]) by the sum of the child support income amounts, in relation to that child, of all the parents of the child.

Section 33: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 12][567] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 34 Child support income amount

(1) 

A parent's _child support income amount_ for a child support year in relation to a child is the person's adjusted taxable income (determined under [section 35][54]) for the relevant tax year minus each of the following:

##### (a) 

the person's living allowance (as determined under [section 35A][55]) for the child support year:

##### (b) 

the sum of any dependent child allowances to which the person is entitled under [section 35B][56] for the child support year:

##### (c) 

any multi-group allowance that relates to the child and to which the person is entitled under [section 36][57] for the child support year.

(2) 

If the result of the calculation in subsection (1) is zero or less, the parent's child support income amount must be treated as being nil.

(3) 

If the adjusted taxable income of a parent of a qualifying child cannot reasonably be ascertained, or cannot be applied by the Commissioner, the parent's child support income amount is to be treated as being,---

##### (a) 

if there is 1 parent whose adjusted taxable income is known, the same as that parent's child support income amount; and

##### (b) 

if there is more than 1 parent whose adjusted taxable income is known, the average of those parents' child support income amounts.

Section 34: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 12][567] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 35 Adjusted taxable income

(1) 

A person's _adjusted taxable income_ for a child support year is the person's taxable income for the relevant tax year adjusted by the adjustments (if any) that would be made to the person's taxable income to determine the person's family scheme income under [subpart MB][568] of the Income Tax Act 2007, except that the following are not to be treated as being part of the person's family scheme income for this purpose:

##### (a) 

income that is exempt income under [section CW 32][569] of the Income Tax Act 2007 (child support and spousal maintenance):

##### (b) 

income referred to in [section MB 11][570] of the Income Tax Act 2007 (income derived by dependent children):

##### (c) 

income referred to in [section MB 12][571] of the Income Tax Act 2007 (non-residents' foreign-sourced income of the person's spouse or partner).

(2) 

However, for the purposes of an assessment of child support for the child support year commencing 1 April 2015 only, the adjustments referred to in subsection (1) must not be applied to a person's taxable income.

(3) 

A person's taxable income must be taken to be their income from employment for the calendar year immediately preceding the start of the child support year if, in the most recent tax year,---

##### (a) 

the person's taxable income was derived solely from withholding income; and

##### (b) 

no adjustments of the sort referred to in subsection (1) are made.

(4) 

If subsection (3) does not apply, a person's taxable income for a child support year must be taken to be their taxable income in the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year, inflated by the inflation percentage for the child support year.

(5) 

The adjustments under subsection (1) that must be applied are those that applied in the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year.

(6) 

If a person's taxable income for a tax year has not been assessed, the Commissioner must determine the person's taxable income,---

##### (a) 

if an income statement has been issued, on that basis; and

##### (b) 

in any other case, on the basis of the income and any other particulars known to the Commissioner.

(7) 

Subsections (3) to (6) are subject to [sections 38 to 39A][66].

##### (b) 

annualised.

(2) 

The amount of living allowance is as follows:

##### (b) 

for a person who has been granted a domestic purposes benefit at the rate payable to a single beneficiary with 1 or more dependent children, under [section 27G][574] of the Social Security Act 1964 (domestic purposes benefit for care at home of the sick or infirm), the amount specified in [Schedule 17][575] of that Act for that benefit type:

##### (c) 

for a person who has been granted an invalid's benefit at the rate payable to a single beneficiary with 1 or more dependent children, under section 40 of the Social Security Act 1964, the amount specified in [Schedule 6][576] of that Act for that benefit type.

(3) 

The version of the appropriate schedule of the [Social Security Act 1964][577] that applies in a child support year is the version in force on 1 January in the immediately preceding child support year.

(4) 

The Commissioner must ensure that notice of the applicable living allowances under this section that apply to the current and (if applicable) the previous child support year is available at all reasonable times on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the Inland Revenue Department.

Section 37: repealed, on 24 October 2001, by [section 260(1)][578] of the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 (2001 No 85).

##### 38 Application of assessments under Income Tax Act 1976 or Tax Administration Act 1994

(1) 

Subject to this Part, where an assessment has been made of a person's taxable income under the Income Tax Act 1976 (other than an assessment made under section 21 of that Act or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511] (other than an assessment made under [section 106][579] of that Act)) for any income year, then, in making a formula assessment, the person's taxable income under the relevant one of those Acts for that income year is, for the purposes of this Act, to be taken to be that taxable income as so assessed or as last so assessed, as the case may be, before the making of the formula assessment.

(2) 

Subsection (1) has effect despite the making, after the making of the formula assessment, of an amendment under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511] to the relevant assessment of the person's taxable income under the relevant one of those Acts (whether or not the amendment is made because of an objection in relation to the assessment).

(3) 

Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the person in any case where---

##### (a) 

the taxable income of that person assessed under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511] in any amended assessment made after the making of a formula assessment for a child support year is more than $500 in excess of, or less than, the taxable income of that person assessed, or last assessed, before the making of the formula assessment; and

##### (b) 

notice of the amended assessment is issued by the Commissioner on or before the last day in the child support year;---

and, where such an amendment is made, the person's taxable income under the relevant Act for that income year is to be taken to be, and always to have been, the person's taxable income for the income year as last so assessed under the relevant Act, and the Commissioner shall amend the formula assessment accordingly.

(4) 

Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the person in any case where the reason (or one of the reasons) that the amendment was made was because, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the return of income made by the person under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511] was fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omitted all mention of income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and, where such an amendment is made, the person's taxable income under the relevant Act for that income year is to be taken to be, and always to have been, the person's taxable income for the income year as last so assessed under the relevant Act.

(5) 

Where---

##### (a) 

the Commissioner, applying subsection (1), assesses the annual amount of child support payable by a person; and

##### (b) 

after the making of the formula assessment, an amendment is made under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511] to the relevant assessment of the taxable income of any parent for the last relevant income year; and

##### (c) 

neither subsection (3) nor subsection (4) applies in relation to the amendment,---

then, in subsequently amending the formula assessment other than for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of [section 39(3)][68] of this Act, the amendment made under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511] is to be disregarded.

(6) 

Where---

##### (a) 

notice of an assessment (including an amended assessment) of a person's taxable income under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511] has been given under the relevant one of those Acts; and

##### (b) 

the notice was dated,---

the assessment is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been made on the date of the notice.

(7) 

Nothing in this section is to be taken to prevent the Commissioner making a determination under [Part 5A][139], [6A][189], or [6B][206] or the court making an order under [Part 7][224].

**b **
> 
> is the number of days in the election period

_election_ means an election, made by a person under [section 40][73], to have the person's estimated taxable income, instead of their original taxable income, applied for the purpose of calculating the person's adjusted taxable income for an election period

##### (a) 

if notice of the election is given under [section 40][73] before the start of the child support year, the child support year; and

Heading: repealed, on 1 April 2015, by [section 13][585] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 40 Estimated taxable income

(1) 

Any person may, by notice to the Commissioner given before or during a child support year, elect that the taxable income to be used to assess their adjusted taxable income for an election period relating to that child support year must be the estimated taxable income specified in the notice of election.

(2) 

The Commissioner, subject to subsections (4) and (6), must accept an election if the sum of the person's year-to-date income (if any) and the person's estimated taxable income is 85% or less than the person's original taxable income.

(3) 

A notice of election must,---

##### (a) 

if notice of the election is given before the start of the child support year to which it relates, state the person's estimated taxable income for the full child support year; or

##### (b) 

if notice of the election is given during the child support year to which it relates, state---

##### (i) 

the person's year-to-date income; and

##### (ii) 

the person's estimated taxable income for the election period.

(4) 

The Commissioner may not accept an election if---

##### (a) 

an income amount order is in force in relation to the person, and to any months in the child support year in respect of which the election is to apply; or

##### (b) 

the person is subject to an order of the court under [section 187][370]; or

##### (c) 

the person has made an election within the previous 3 months, and the proposed new election would change the person's annualised estimated taxable income by $500 or less; or

##### (d) 

the person made an election in relation to an earlier child support year and was required to provide a return of income under the [Income Tax Act 2007][586] or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][587] in relation to that year, but, at the time the notice is given under this section, the person is in breach of the requirement to furnish a return of income in respect of that year; or

##### (e) 

the person's annualised estimated taxable income is more than their original taxable income.

(5) 

A notice under this section may be given in any form acceptable to the Commissioner, and is to be treated by the Commissioner as having been given in the month in which it was sent or provided by the person making the election, even if it is received by the Commissioner in the following month.

(6) 

The Commissioner may decline to accept an election if the person making the election does not, on request by the Commissioner, provide the information and evidence that the Commissioner requires in order to support the making of the estimate.

Section 40(1): amended, on 1 April 2015, by [section 208(1)][588] of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 (2014 No 39).

##### 41 Effect of election

(1) 

If the Commissioner accepts an election made by a person, the Commissioner must determine the person's adjusted taxable income by---

##### (a) 

calculating the person's annualised estimated taxable income; and

##### (b) 

adjusting the annualised estimated taxable income by the adjustments referred to in [section 35][54], based on the adjustments applying to the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year, and applying those adjustments at a uniform daily rate throughout the election period.

(2) 

The Commissioner must then adjust any formula assessment applying to the person during the election period and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the amount of child support payable per day during the election period reflects the adjusted assessment.

(3) 

The making of an election does not prevent the Commissioner making a determination under [Part 5A][139], [6A][189], or [6B][206], or the court making an order under [Part 7][224].

Section 41: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 13][585] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 42 Revocation of election and subsequent elections

(1) 

A person who has made an election in relation to a child support year may revoke the election, before or during the child support year, by giving notice to the Commissioner; and the revocation takes effect from the start of the election period to which any election applied.

(2) 

If an election is in effect but the person then makes a later election,---

##### (a) 

if the Commissioner accepts the later election,---

##### (i) 

the later election takes effect from the start of the month in which the notice of election is given, and [section 41][74] applies accordingly; and

##### (ii) 

the earlier election ceases to have effect on the last day of the previous month:

##### (b) 

if the Commissioner does not accept the later election because the amount of year-to-date taxable income plus the new estimated taxable income is more than 85% of the person's original taxable income, then the earlier estimate is deemed to be revoked:

##### (c) 

if the Commissioner does not accept the election for any other reason, the earlier estimate remains in effect.

(3) 

A revocation is of no effect to the extent that it is inconsistent with an income amount order.

Section 42: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 13][585] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 43 Effect of revocation of election

(1) 

When an election is revoked, or deemed to be revoked, the Commissioner must---

##### (a) 

adjust any formula assessment applying to the person on the basis of the person's original adjusted taxable income; and

##### (b) 

take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the amount of child support payable per day, during the election period to which the revoked election relates, reflects that adjusted assessment.

(2) 

The revocation of an election does not prevent the Commissioner making a determination under [Part 5A][139], [6A][189], or [6B][206], or the court making an order under [Part 7][224], or a person making a further election.

Section 43: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 13][585] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 44 End-of-year reconciliation

(1) 

For the purpose of determining whether a person has, or has been, underpaid or overpaid child support in an election period, after the end of the child support year to which an election relates, the Commissioner must complete an assessment for the person based on the income amount determined under subsection (2).

(2) 

The income amount to be used for the assessment is,---

##### (a) 

if the actual taxable income earned by the person during the year is equal to or less than the year-to-date income specified in the notice of election, the value of any adjustments made under [section 41(1)(b)][74]; or

##### (b) 

if the actual taxable income earned by the person during the year is more than the year-to-date income specified in the notice of election, the lesser of the following:

##### (i) 

the person's actual taxable income earned in the election period (which is the actual taxable income earned in the full year less the year-to-date income specified in a notice of election), annualised in accordance with the formula in subsection (3) (which gives the _annualised actual taxable income in the election period_), and adjusted in accordance with [section 41(1)(b)][74]:

##### (ii) 

the person's original adjusted taxable income.

(3) 

The formula for annualising a person's actual taxable income in an election period is---

a 365

b

where---

**a **
> 
> is the actual taxable income earned during the election period

**b **
> 
> is the number of days in the election period.

(4) 

After comparing the result of the assessment done under subsection (1) with the results obtained under [section 41][74], the Commissioner must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the correct amount of child support is assessed for the child support year.

(5) 

A reconciliation under this section is subject to any income amount order that applies during all or any part of an election period.

Section 44: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 13][585] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

Section 44(2): replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 209][589] of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 (2014 No 39).

##### 44A Determining income amount if no tax return filed

(1) 

This section applies if the Commissioner cannot determine the person's actual taxable income during a child support year because the person, having been required to provide a return of income in respect of the tax year that corresponds to the child support year, has failed to provide it within 28 days of the requirement to provide it.

(2) 

Where this section applies, the Commissioner must determine that the amount to be used for the purpose of the assessment under [section 44(2)][77] is the same as the person's original adjusted taxable income, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that there is reasonable cause for the failure to provide the return of income.

(3) 

A determination under subsection (2) is final unless, within 28 days after the person receives notification from the Commissioner of the determination, the person---

##### (a) 

makes an objection under [section 90][182]; or

##### (b) 

provides a return of income in respect of the relevant tax year to the Commissioner.

(4) 

In subsection (2), _reasonable cause_ means a circumstance that, on application being made by the person under [section 37(3)][590] of the Tax Administration Act 1994, results in the Commissioner extending the time for providing the return.

Section 44A: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 13][585] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

#### Penalties for underestimation

##### 45 Penalty if estimated income less than 80% of actual income

(1) 

A person is liable to a penalty under this section if their year-to-date income (if any) specified in the notice of election plus the estimated taxable income for the election period is less than 80% of---

##### (a) 

their actual taxable income for the child support year; or

##### (b) 

the amount determined under [section 44A(2)][78].

(2) 

The penalty is 10% of the difference between---

##### (a) 

the annual amount of child support that was assessed under [section 41][74] as payable in the election period; and

##### (b) 

the reconciled annual amount of child support payable in the election period, as determined under [section 44][77].

(3) 

However, no penalty is payable by a receiving parent if the amount that the liable parent pays has been determined under the multi-group cap referred to in [section 31(3)][48].

(4) 

The Commissioner must write off a penalty to which a person is liable under this section, or any part of the penalty, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person, in relation to an election period in a child support year, has become liable to pay a penalty under this section as the result of the taxable income derived by the person in the child support year being higher than it would otherwise have been by reason of---

##### (a) 

the enactment of any Act amending the [Income Tax Act 2007][586], or the making of any regulation or Order in Council relating to income tax, during the period commencing on the first day of the last month in that child support year and ending with the due date for payments in respect of that month; or

##### (b) 

the Commissioner making public, during that period, any ruling in relation to any provision of the [Income Tax Act 2007][586], and that ruling is different from a ruling previously made public by the Commissioner in relation to that provision; or

##### (c) 

the adoption by the person of an incorrect interpretation of any provision of this Act or of the [Income Tax Act 2007][586], being an interpretation which, although incorrect, is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case.

(5) 

Subject to the other provisions of this Part, the other Parts of this Act apply with respect to any penalty payable under this section as if it were a penalty payable under [section 134][282], except that late payment penalties do not apply to penalties imposed under this section.

Section 45: replaced, on 1 April 2015, by [section 13][585] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

##### 46 Interest to be charged on underestimations\[Repealed\]

##### 85 Assumptions as to future events

Compare: Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 s 73 (Aust)

Section 85: amended, on 26 April 2005, by [section 3][526] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2005 (2005 No 6).

##### 86 Commissioner to give effect to changed circumstances

Where child support is payable in respect of a qualifying child and the Commissioner is notified, or otherwise becomes aware,---

##### (a) 

that the liability of a liable parent to pay child support to a carer in respect of the child has ceased in accordance with [section 25][40] or [62][102]; or

##### (b) 

that an event or change of circumstances has occurred that alters the respective liability or entitlement of any parent or carer of the qualifying child,---

the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, take such action as is necessary to take account of the event or change in circumstances (whether by amending any assessment or otherwise).

(2) 

Where domestic maintenance is payable by a liable spouse or partner under a voluntary agreement or an order of the court and either---

##### (a) 

payment is to cease, or the rate of payment is to reduce, on a particular day in accordance with that agreement or order; or

##### (b) 

the Commissioner is notified, or otherwise becomes aware,---

##### (i) 

of the death of either party to the agreement; or

##### (ii) 

that an event or change of circumstances has occurred that affects the annual rate at which domestic maintenance is payable under this Act,---

the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, take such action as is necessary to take account of the event or change in circumstances (whether by amending any assessment or otherwise).

(3) 

Nothing in subsection (1) or subsection (2) is to be taken to prevent the Commissioner from taking such action as the Commissioner considers appropriate to take account of the likely occurrence of an event or change of circumstances of which the Commissioner is notified or otherwise becomes aware (whether by amending any assessment or otherwise).

the child support year, or the part of the child support year, to which the assessment relates has ended; or

correcting any error or mistake (whether or not made by the Commissioner); or

correcting the effect of any false or misleading statement made to the Commissioner; or

##### (c) 

giving effect to the happening of an event or change of circumstances to which the provisions of [section 86][134] apply; or

giving effect to a formula assessment of child support by the Commissioner; or

##### (da) 

giving effect to [Part 5A][139]; or

(4) 

Where a provision of this Act expressly authorises the Commissioner to amend an assessment, that provision does not by implication limit the power of the Commissioner (whether under this section or otherwise) to amend the assessment.

(5) 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, every amended assessment is to be taken to be an assessment for all the purposes of this Act.

(6) 

In any case where---

##### (a) 

child support or domestic maintenance payable under an amended assessment is increased after the due date; and

##### (b) 

the Commissioner is satisfied that the matter giving rise to the increase did not result from any neglect or default by the person who is required to pay that child support or that domestic maintenance under the amended assessment,---

that person---

##### (c) 

shall pay by the due date the amount that would have been payable if the increase had not taken effect; and

##### (d) 

shall pay the amount of the increase within 30 days after the date of the amended assessment,---

and the Commissioner shall fix that date as the new due date for payment.

##### 105 Matters as to which court must be satisfied before making order

(1) 

Where an application is made to a Family Court under [section 104][241] for an order in relation to a child and the court is satisfied that---

##### (a) 

1 or more of the grounds for departure mentioned in subsection (2) exists or exist; and

##### (b) 

it would be---

##### (i) 

just and equitable as regards the child, the receiving carer, and the liable parent; and

##### (ii) 

otherwise proper,---

to make a particular order of the type specified in [section 106][243],---

the court may make the order.

(2) 

For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the grounds for departure are as follows:

##### (a) 

that, by virtue of special circumstances, the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced because of---

##### (i) 

the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; or

##### (ii) 

special needs of any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; or

##### (iii) 

commitments of the parent necessary to enable the parent to support---

##### (A) 

himself or herself; or

##### (B) 

any other child or another person whom the parent has a duty to maintain; or

##### (b) 

that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected because---

##### (i) 

of high costs incurred by a parent or a receiving carer in enabling a parent or receiving carer to have contact with the child; or

##### (ii) 

of special needs of the child; or

##### (iii) 

the child is being cared for, educated, or trained in the manner that was expected by either of his or her parents; or

##### (c) 

that, by virtue of special circumstances, application in relation to the child of the provisions of this Act relating to formula assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child because of---

##### (i) 

the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of either parent or the child; or

##### (ii) 

any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made (whether under this Act, the [Property (Relationships) Act 1976][653] or otherwise) by the liable parent or a receiving carer to the child, to a liable parent or a receiving carer, or to any other person for the benefit of the child; or

##### (iii) 

an entitlement of the liable parent or receiving carer to the continued occupancy of a property in which the liable parent or receiving carer has a financial interest.

(3) 

For the purposes of subsection (2)(b)(i), costs incurred in enabling a parent or receiving carer to have contact with the child are not to be taken to be high unless the total of those costs during a child support year is more than 5% of the adjusted taxable income for the year of the person incurring the costs.

(4) 

In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, a receiving carer, and the liable parent to make a particular order of the type specified in [section 106][243], the court shall have regard to---

##### (a) 

the objects of this Act, and, in particular, the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child and the fact that it is the parents of a child themselves who have the primary duty to maintain the child; and

##### (b) 

the proper needs of the child, having regard to---

##### (i) 

the manner in which the child is being, and in which the parents expect the child to be, cared for, educated, or trained; and

##### (ii) 

any special needs of the child; and

##### (c) 

the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of the child; and

##### (d) 

the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of each parent who is a party to the proceeding; and

##### (e) 

the commitments of each parent who is a party to the proceeding that are necessary to enable the parent to support---

##### (i) 

himself or herself; or

##### (ii) 

any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; and

##### (f) 

the direct and indirect costs incurred by the receiving carer in providing care for the child, including the income and earning capacity foregone by the receiving carer in providing that care; and

##### (g) 

any hardship that would be caused to---

##### (i) 

the child or the receiving carer by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order; or

##### (ii) 

the liable parent, or any other child or another person that the liable parent has a duty to support, by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order.

(5) 

In having regard to the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of the child or a parent of the child, the court must---

##### (a) 

have regard to the capacity of the child or parent to earn or derive income, including having regard to any assets of, under the control of, or held for the benefit of, the child or parent that do not produce, but are capable of producing, income; and

##### (b) 

disregard the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of any person who does not have a duty to maintain the child, or who has such a duty but is not a party to the proceeding, unless, in the special circumstances of the case, the court considers that it is appropriate to have regard to them.

(6) 

The court may have regard to other matters beyond those specified in subsections (4) and (5).

##### (b) 

the liable parent is also liable to pay child support to that receiving carer in respect of that child under a formula assessment,---

the court shall provide that the liable parent's liability to provide child support under the lump sum order shall be credited against his or her liability to pay child support under the formula assessment for any period to which the lump sum order relates unless the court is satisfied that, in the special circumstances of the case, it would be---

##### (c) 

just and equitable as regards the child, the liable parent, and the receiving carer; and

##### (d) 

otherwise proper,---

that the child support should not be so credited.

(2) 

The court shall state in the lump sum order whether or not any such credit has been given.

(3) 

If the court states in the order that the child support is to be credited against the liable parent's liability under any relevant formula assessment, the court must also state in the order either---

##### (a) 

that the child support has an annual value of a specified amount and that the annual rate of the child support payable under any relevant formula assessment is to be reduced by that amount (but not in a child support year below the minimum annual rate for that year under [section 72(1)(a)][118]); or

##### (b) 

that the child support is to count for a specified percentage of the annual rate of child support payable under any relevant formula assessment.

(4) 

The court may, under subsections (1) and (3), make different provision in relation to different child support years and in relation to different parts of a child support year.

(5) 

In making a determination under subsection (1)(d), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in [section 105(4) and (5)][242].

If a Family Court makes an order under [section 109][247] that includes a statement that the child support ordered to be provided by the liable parent is to be credited against the liable parent's liability under any relevant formula assessment, when the decision of the court making the order becomes final, the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, take such action as is necessary to give effect to the order in relation to any relevant formula assessment that has been made (whether by amending the assessment or otherwise).

(2) 

In subsequently making a relevant formula assessment, the Commissioner shall---

##### (a) 

calculate what would, apart from the application of the order, be the annual rate of child support payable by the liable parent to the receiving carer entitled to child support; and

##### (b) 

reduce that annual rate by the amount or percentage specified in the statement included in the order under [section 110(3)][248]; and

##### (c) 

make the assessment on the basis of that reduced annual rate.

#### Discharge, suspension, revival, and variation of orders

##### 112 Discharge, suspension, revival, and variation of orders

(1) 

A receiving carer or a liable parent or the Commissioner may apply to a Family Court for an order to discharge, suspend, revive, or vary any order made by a Family Court under [section 103D][238] or [section 106][243] or [section 109][247].

(2) 

If an order under [section 103D][238] or [section 106][243] or [section 109][247] is in force in relation to a child (whether or not all things ordered to be done by the order have been done), a Family Court may, on receipt of an application made under subsection (1) or where it is satisfied that it ought to do so, by order---

##### (a) 

discharge the order; or

##### (b) 

suspend its operation wholly or in part and either until a further order or until a fixed time or the happening of a future event; or

##### (c) 

if the operation of the order has been suspended under paragraph (b), revive its operation wholly or in part; or

##### (d) 

subject to subsection (3), vary the order (including any statement included in the order under [section 110][248]) in any way, but not---

##### (i) 

in a way that is inconsistent with the provisions of the section under which the order was made; or

##### (ii) 

so as to reduce the liability of any person to pay child support in a child support year below the equivalent of an annual rate that is equal to the minimum annual rate for that year under [section 72(1)(a)][118].

(3) 

The court shall not discharge, suspend, revive, or vary an order under subsection (1) unless the court is satisfied, having regard in particular to any statement included in the order under [section 110][248], that it would be---

##### (a) 

just and equitable as regards the child, the receiving carer, and the liable parent concerned; and

##### (b) 

otherwise proper,---

to make the order.

(4) 

The court shall not, by any order under this section, vary an order unless it is also satisfied---

##### (a) 

that making the variation is justified because of a change in the circumstances of the child, the receiving carer, or a liable parent concerned since the order was made or last varied; or

##### (b) 

that making the variation is justified because of a change in the all groups index number of the New Zealand Consumer Price Index since the order was made or last varied; or

##### (c) 

in a case where the order was made by consent, that the order is not proper or adequate; or

##### (d) 

that material facts were withheld from the court that made the order or from a court that varied the order, or that material evidence previously given before such a court was false.

(5) 

If the court proposes to vary the order otherwise than by varying any statement included in the order under [section 110][248], the court must consider whether, having regard to the proposed variation, it should also order the variation of any such statement.

(6) 

In determining whether to make an order under this section, the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in [section 105(4) and (5)][242].

(7) 

The court may have regard to other matters beyond those specified in subsection (6).

(8) 

The court must not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the all groups index number of the New Zealand Consumer Price Index unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made, or was last varied having regard to such a change.

(9) 

In satisfying itself for the purposes of subsection (4)(c), the court must have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made by the liable parent to the child, to the receiving carer, or to any other person for the benefit of the child.

(10) 

The discharge of an order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order, or under this Act, when the discharge takes effect.

#### Orders to set aside voluntary agreements

##### 113 Power to set aside agreements

(1) 

A Family Court may set aside a voluntary agreement if the court is satisfied, on application by a party to the agreement, that the concurrence of the party was obtained by fraud or undue influence or that the party was influenced in his or her decision to enter into the agreement by a mistake that was material to him or her.

(2) 

Subject to [section 125][269], the parties to a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section are the parties to the agreement.

(4) 

An order under subsection (3) may be made in the proceedings in which the order is set aside or in other proceedings brought on the application of a person who is or was a receiving carer, or a liable parent, in relation to the child concerned.

##### 166 Position where liable person has 2 or more employers

(1) 

Where a liable person is in receipt of source deduction payments from 2 or more employers, the Commissioner may---

##### (a) 

treat any one of the employers as the only employer for the purposes of this Part; or

##### (b) 

apply this Part in relation to any 2 or more of the employers with such modifications as the Commissioner considers appropriate, being modifications made for the purpose of ensuring that the amounts collected under this Part in relation to the liability are, in the aggregate, the same as those that would be collected in relation to the liability if the liable person had only 1 employer.

(2) 

Without limiting the generality of subsection (1)(b), where a liable person has more than 1 employer, the Commissioner may, under that subsection and on the request of the liable person, disregard, and instruct an employer of the liable person, or a PAYE intermediary for the employer, to disregard, the provisions of [section 165(1)][342] provided that the total deductions made under deduction notices by all employers of the liable person and all PAYE intermediaries must not reduce the person's total net earnings in respect of a pay period to an amount that is less than 60% of the residue that remains after deducting from the source deduction payments the amount of any tax withheld under the PAYE rules of the [Income Tax Act 2007][586].

##### 167 Deductions to be held on trust

(1) 

For the purposes of this section, _financial support deduction_ means a periodic deduction made by a payer in terms of [section 159][336]; but does not include any penalty imposed under this Act.

(2) 

The amount of every financial support deduction made by any payer under this Part shall be held in trust for the Crown, and any amount so held in trust shall not be property of the payer liable to execution.

##### 168 Payer failing to make financial support deductions

(1) 

Where a payer fails to make a deduction in accordance with the payer's obligations under this Part, the amount in respect of which default has been made shall constitute a debt payable by the payer to the Commissioner, and shall be deemed to have become due and payable to the Commissioner on the 20th day of the month following the month in which that deduction was required to be made in accordance with those obligations.

(2) 

Nothing in this section shall apply to a failure by a bank to make a deduction from a bank account.

(3) 

The right of the Commissioner to recover from the payer the amount in respect of which default has been made shall be in addition to any right of the Commissioner to recover that amount from the liable person under this Act; and nothing in this Part shall be construed as preventing the Commissioner from taking such steps as the Commissioner thinks fit to recover that amount from the payer and from the liable person concurrently, or from recovering that amount wholly from the payer or wholly from the liable person or partly from the payer and partly from the liable person.

(4) 

Where any amount required to be deducted in accordance with this Part from any money payable to a liable person is instead paid to the Commissioner by the payer of the amount payable, the amount so paid to the Commissioner may be recovered by the payer from the liable person.

Compare: 1976 No 65 s 366

##### 169 Unpaid financial support to constitute charge on payer's property

(1) 

Where a payer fails wholly or in part to make any deduction in accordance with that payer's obligations under this Part, or is liable to pay any sum to the Commissioner under this Part or the [Tax Administration Act 1994][511], an amount equal to the total for the time being unpaid to the Commissioner in respect of that deduction or that sum (including any interest or penalty), and in respect of any judgment obtained therefor (including any costs, fees, or expenses included in the judgment or otherwise payable by the payer to the Commissioner in respect thereof) shall be a charge on all the real and personal property of the payer.

(2) 

Nothing in this section shall apply to a failure by a bank to make a deduction from a bank account.

(3) 

Every charge created by this section shall be subject to any mortgage, charge, or encumbrance that exists at the time of the creation of the charge and that either---

##### (a) 

has been registered under any registration Act to which the property is subject; or

##### (b) 

that is valid and effectual under the [Personal Property Securities Act 1999][713] without registration thereof,---

but, subject to this section, shall have priority over all other mortgages, charges, or encumbrances. Notwithstanding anything in any other Act, if any property subject to the charge created by this section is also subject to a charge created by that other Act, the charges shall rank equally with each other unless by virtue of that Act the charge created thereby would be deferred to the charge created by this section.

(4) 

Despite [section 23(b)][714] of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, if a charge affects property against which charges may be registered under a registration Act, the Commissioner may register the charge under the registration Act.

(4B) 

The Commissioner is not required to pay a fee for the registration of a charge under a registration Act in reliance on this section.

(5) 

For the purpose of this section, _registration Act_, in relation to any property, includes---

##### (a) 

the [Statutory Land Charges Registration Act 1928][715] in every case where the property is land or an interest in land (including a mortgage):

##### (b) 

the [Personal Property Securities Act 1999][713].

(6) 

Particulars recorded under subsection (4) are to operate and take priority according to the provisions of the applicable registration Act.

(6B) 

If the registration under this section of a charge over property occurs after the registration of a mortgage over the same property and before an advance of money secured by the mortgage, the charge has priority over the mortgage in respect of that money.

(7) 

On the satisfaction of a charge that is registered under a registration Act in reliance on this section, the Commissioner must release the charge in the manner required by the registration Act, with such modifications as may be necessary.

(7B) 

The Commissioner is not required to pay a fee for the release of a charge that is registered under a registration Act in reliance on this section.

(8) 

Any charge created by this section which is registered against any property shall operate to secure any amount secured by any prior unregistered charge and unpaid at the time of registration of the charge, and also to secure any amount secured by any charge coming into existence after the registration of the charge, so that the registered charge shall operate to secure the total of all amounts for the time being owing by the payer under all charges created by this section.

(9) 

If any amount constitutes by virtue of this section a charge on any property, a Family Court or a District Court may make such order as it thinks fit, either for the sale of that property or of any part thereof, or for the appointment of a receiver of the rents, profits, or income thereof, and for the payment of the amount of the charge and the costs of the Commissioner out of the proceeds of the sale or out of the rents, profits, or income.

(10) 

Where any property has been sold under any such order, the Family Court or, as the case may be, the District Court may, on the application of the purchaser or the Commissioner, make an order vesting the property in the purchaser.

(11) 

Every such vesting order shall have the same effect as if all persons entitled to the property had been free from all disability and had duly executed all proper conveyances, transfers, and assignments of the property for such estate or interest as is specified in the order; and in the case of land which is subject to the [Land Transfer Act 1952][716] the purchaser's title thereto shall be registered accordingly.

(12) 

This section shall apply subject to [section 167][344].

(6) 

Where goods have been seized under a warrant to seize property and some third person claims to be entitled to the goods either as owner under a hire purchase agreement or under a bill of sale or otherwise by way of security for a debt, a court presided over by a Family Court Judge or District Court Judge may order a sale of the whole or part of the goods upon such terms as to payment of the whole or part of the secured debt or otherwise as the court thinks fit, and may direct the application of the proceeds of the sale in such manner and upon such terms as it deems just.

Notwithstanding subsection (4), the receiver shall not expend in any one year (being a year commencing from the date of the receiver's appointment or any subsequent year), in repairing and keeping in good repair and condition all buildings and other improvements on the land, a sum exceeding $2,000, unless the expenditure is first authorised by the court.

to hold the residue of the money so received until the charge or the receiving order is discharged, or the court sooner directs, and then to pay it to the person who would be entitled to the money if no such charge or receiving order was in force.

[s 36D][63]

Schedule 3: inserted, on 1 April 2015, by [section 33][843] of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 12).

This table sets out percentages of child support income amounts that are expended on children. The percentages represent marginal expenditure, which means how much of each additional dollar of child support income in an AWE\* band is treated as expenditure on children. Where child support income extends over several AWE bands, expenditure therefore accumulates down the columns.

**Fraction of AWE****Percentages of child support income amounts**

_Age group: all children aged 0 to 12__Age group: all, or the oldest 3, children aged 13 or over__Age group: at least 1 child aged 0 to 12, and 1 or 2 children aged 13 or over_

Number of childrenNumber of childrenNumber of children

\*Average weekly earnings, as published by Statistics New Zealand (for all industries, males and females combined) for the June quarter in the immediately preceding child support year. The weekly earnings are annualised.

 For child support income amounts that exceed 2.5 times AWE, the marginal expenditure on children does not increase. The relevant amounts to be inserted in a child expenditure table in this row are therefore the maximum amounts from the row immediately above it.
