## Part 6 Use of animals in research, testing, and teaching

##### 80 Purposes

(1) 

The principal purpose of this Part is to ensure that the use of animals in research, testing, and teaching is confined to cases in which there is good reason to believe---

##### (a) 

that the findings of the research or testing or the results of the teaching will enhance---

##### (i) 

the understanding of human beings, animals, or ecosystems; or

##### (ii) 

the maintenance or protection of human or animal health or welfare; or

##### (iii) 

the management, protection, or control of ecosystems, plants, animals, or native fauna; or

##### (iv) 

the production and productivity of animals; or

##### (v) 

the achievement of educational objectives; and

##### (b) 

that the benefits derived from the use of animals in research, testing, and teaching (whether the direct benefits of a project or the likely benefits of that project when combined with the findings of other related projects that have been undertaken in the past or that are currently being undertaken or are planned for the future) are not outweighed by the likely harm to the animals; and

##### (c) 

that, where the research, testing, or teaching involves the use of a non-human hominid, that research, testing, or teaching may be carried out only where either---

##### (i) 

it is in the best interests of the non-human hominid; or

##### (ii) 

it is in the interest of the species to which the non-human hominid belongs and the benefits to be derived from the use of the non-human hominid in the research, testing, or teaching (being benefits of the kind described in paragraph (b)) are not outweighed by the likely harm to the non-human hominid.

(2) 

The other purposes of this Part are---

##### (a) 

to ensure that,---

##### (i) 

in relation to animals used in research, testing, and teaching, all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the physical, health, and behavioural needs of those animals are met in accordance with both good practice and scientific knowledge; and

##### (ii) 

where animals used in research, testing, and teaching are ill or injured, they receive, where practicable, treatment that alleviates any unreasonable or unnecessary pain or distress:

##### (iii) 

where, because of the nature of the research, testing, or teaching, the needs referred to in subparagraph (i) cannot be fully met or the treatment referred to in subparagraph (ii) cannot be provided, any degree of pain or distress is reduced to the minimum possible in the circumstances:

##### (b) 

to promote efforts---

##### (i) 

to reduce the number of animals used in research, testing, and teaching to the minimum necessary:

##### (ii) 

to refine techniques used in any research, testing, and teaching so that the harm caused to the animals is minimised and the benefits are maximised:

##### (iii) 

to replace animals as subjects for research, and testing by substituting, where appropriate, non-sentient or non-living alternatives:

##### (iv) 

to replace the use of animals in teaching by substituting for animals, where appropriate, non-sentient or non-living alternatives or by imparting the information in another way.

##### 81 Effect of this Part

(1) 

Nothing in [Parts 1][11] and [2][38] prevents animals being used in research, testing, or teaching in accordance with this Part.

(2) 

The limitation imposed by subsection (1) on the application of [Parts 1][11] and [2][38] does not apply in any case where any animal is used in research, testing, or teaching other than in accordance with this Part or other than in accordance with the conditions of any project approval.

(3) 

To avoid doubt, nothing in this Part applies in relation to the use of animals for any purpose that does not involve research, testing, or teaching.

must take reasonable steps to identify the owner of the animal; and

may take such steps as it considers necessary or desirable to prevent or mitigate any suffering of the animal.

##### (a) 

an owner of an animal, or a person acting as the agent of an owner of an animal, gives the animal into the temporary custody of an approved organisation; and

sell the animal; or

establishing any minimum standard that could be established under [Part 5][96], or amending, revoking, or replacing any minimum standard or any part of a minimum standard established under Part 5\.

(2) 

Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), regulations made under this section may prescribe standards or requirements that do not fully meet---

##### (a) 

the obligations of [section 10][14] or [11][15]; or

##### (b) 

the obligations that a person would need to observe in the treatment, transport, or killing of animals if that person were to avoid committing an offence against [section 12(c)][17], [21(b)][28], [22(2)][30], [23(1)][31], 23(2), or [29(a)][43].

(3) 

The Minister must not recommend the making of regulations in reliance on subsection (2) unless he or she is satisfied that either or both of the following apply:

##### (a) 

any adverse effects of a change from current practices to new practices have been considered and there are no feasible or practical alternatives currently available:

##### (b) 

not to do so would result in an unreasonable impact on a particular industry sector within New Zealand, a sector of the public, or New Zealand's wider economy.

(4) 

In deciding whether any impact is unreasonable under subsection (3)`(b), the Minister must have regard to the welfare of any affected animals.

(5) 

Any regulations made in reliance on subsection (2) in accordance with the considerations in subsection (3) must provide for the regulations to be in force for a period of time specified in the regulations (the _specified period_) that---

##### (a) 

is reasonably necessary to enable a transition from current practice to a practice that fully meets the obligations specified in subsection (2)`(a) and (b); and

##### (b) 

does not exceed 10 years (which period may, however, be extended once under subsection (6)).

(6) 

The specified period may be extended once only by up to 5 years by regulations made under this subsection on the recommendation of the Minister if he or she is satisfied that the majority of participants in the sector concerned---

have made significant progress towards implementing compliant practice; and

cannot reasonably be expected to become compliant before the close of the specified period, taking into account the steps that still need to be completed for implementation of compliant practice; and

##### (c) 

will become compliant within the extended period.

(7) 

Despite subsections (3) to (6), if the Minister considers that requiring a practice to fully meet the obligations specified in subsection (2)`(a) and (b) would impose an unjustifiable limitation on the requirements of a religious or cultural practice, the Minister may recommend the making of regulations in reliance on subsection (2) for an indefinite period subject to review at 10-yearly intervals or shorter intervals specified in the regulations.

(8) 

In reaching a decision not to recommend the making of regulations in reliance on subsection (2), the Minister may consider any factors that the Minister thinks would make such regulations contrary to New Zealand's overall interests (including, without limitation, health, social, economic, international, or environmental interests).

(9) 

Nothing in this section obliges the Minister to recommend the making of regulations in reliance on subsection (2).

(10) 

The Minister must consult the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee before recommending the making of any regulations under this section (other than regulations already proposed by the Committee), but nothing in [sections 71 to 75][100] applies in relation to the making of regulations under subsection (1)`(b).

(11) 

If a person does or omits to do anything in reliance on regulations made under subsection (2) that would otherwise be a contravention of, or failure to comply with, any provision of [Part 1][11] or [2][38], the person has a defence to a prosecution for an offence under this Act in respect of the act or omission if the court is satisfied that the act or omission was authorised by the regulations.

any other matter the Minister considers relevant.

(3) 

The Minister must consult the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee before recommending the making of regulations under this section (other than regulations proposed by the Committee).
